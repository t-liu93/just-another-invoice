# Yet Another Ledger

> 🌐 **English** · [中文](README_zh.md)

Self-hosted invoicing and small-business administration for freelancers and small businesses. Invoices, quotes, expenses, payments, PDF + email, and Dutch **BTW (VAT) return** summaries — run with Docker Compose (a single app container plus PostgreSQL).

Built with **FastAPI + Vue 3 + PostgreSQL**.

> **Status — beta (`v0.1.0-beta0`).** Open source and self-hosted. Container images are published to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR). Expect rough edges and breaking changes before `v1.0`.

## Features

- **Invoices** — backend pricing engine (line/document discounts, inclusive/exclusive VAT, multiple rates), concurrency-safe custom numbering, lifecycle + payment status.
- **Quotes** — reusable content blocks/templates, one-click convert to invoice, auto-expiry.
- **Cost estimation → quote** — internal margin-based costing that never leaks cost/margin to the customer.
- **Payments** — partial payments with automatic `UNPAID → PARTIALLY_PAID → PAID` transitions.
- **Expenses** — AI receipt extraction, recurring expenses, bookkeeping fields (paid-by / business-use % / depreciation years).
- **Customers & catalog** — addresses, VAT IDs, per-customer currency & document language; product/material catalog.
- **Documents** — invoice / quote / receipt PDFs (EN/ZH) and email sending with editable templates.
- **Reports** — Profit & Loss, **Dutch BTW VAT-return summary**, ICP listing, expense report, and an ECharts dashboard.
- **Platform** — TOTP two-factor auth, typed three-tier settings, `Decimal` money math, bilingual UI (English / 中文), single-container app deployed via Docker Compose.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Backend | FastAPI · SQLAlchemy 2.0 (async) · Alembic · fastapi-users · PostgreSQL (asyncpg) · Python 3.12 (uv) |
| Frontend | Vue 3 + TypeScript · Pinia · Vue Router · Vite · Naive UI · ECharts |
| Packaging | Single app container (frontend build + backend + uvicorn) + PostgreSQL, run with Docker Compose |

## Quick start

Pull the published image and run it with Docker Compose (app + PostgreSQL).

**Prerequisites:** Docker + Docker Compose, and `git`.

```bash
# 1. Clone (for docker-compose.yml + .env.example)
git clone https://github.com/yet-another-ledger/yet-another-ledger.git
cd yet-another-ledger

# 2. Configure (the template already sets COOKIE_SECURE=false for local HTTP)
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Pre-create the receipt-storage folder owned by your user
#    (the app container runs as uid:gid 1000:1000 by default; set PUID/PGID
#    in .env if your user differs)
mkdir -p data/storage

# 4. Pull images and start (runs DB migrations, then app + PostgreSQL)
docker compose up -d
```

Open **http://localhost:8000**, register the first (owner) account, and set up TOTP two-factor authentication. The app is published on `127.0.0.1` only; put it behind a TLS reverse proxy for remote access.

To stop: `docker compose down` (add `-v` to also drop the database volume).

> `:latest` currently tracks the newest beta; pin a version by setting `JAI_IMAGE=ghcr.io/yet-another-ledger/yet-another-ledger:0.1.0-beta0` in `.env`. To build the image yourself instead of pulling, run `docker build -t ghcr.io/yet-another-ledger/yet-another-ledger:latest .` before `docker compose up -d`.

## Configuration

Compose reads `.env` automatically. The most useful variables:

| Variable | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POSTGRES_USER` / `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` / `POSTGRES_DB` | `jai` | Database credentials (shared by app + Postgres). |
| `APP_HOST_PORT` | `8000` | Host port the app is published on (loopback). |
| `COOKIE_SECURE` | `false` in `.env.example` | Must be `true` in production behind HTTPS. |
| `BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8000` | Public URL used for absolute links in emails. |
| `STORAGE_DIR` | `./data/storage` | Host folder bind-mounted for receipts/attachments. |
| `PUID` / `PGID` | `1000` | Host uid:gid the app runs as (owns the storage folder). |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | auto | Auto-generated and persisted on first boot; set only to pin an external secret. |

SMTP (for password-reset and sending invoices) is configured in-app under Settings after first login.

## Development

Run the full dev stack (app + Postgres, with the dev override) from source:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

Backend lives in `backend/` (`uv run ...`), frontend in `frontend/` (`npm run ...`). Conventions, red lines, and the contract-first workflow are documented in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

## Roadmap

Milestones through M11.5 are complete. M12 is the active planning milestone for Standard/Advance/Final Invoices and Credit Notes; M13 is the subsequent self-hosting wrap-up (backups, i18n completion, docs). See [`docs/plan/roadmap.md`](docs/plan/roadmap.md).

## Documentation

Docs are English-first with a synchronized Chinese mirror (`*_zh.md`). Start at [`docs/plan/roadmap.md`](docs/plan/roadmap.md); the Dutch VAT/BTW filing basis is in [`docs/insight/btw-aangifte-2026-guide.md`](docs/insight/btw-aangifte-2026-guide.md).
