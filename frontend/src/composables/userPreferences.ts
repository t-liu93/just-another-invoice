/**
 * Server-backed user preferences — single source of truth for ``theme`` and
 * ``locale`` (both stored at USER level under ``user.preferences`` and served
 * by ``GET/PUT /api/v1/settings/me``).
 *
 * Why a shared module (not two independent composables)
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 * The PUT endpoint *replaces* the whole ``UserPreferences`` object.  If theme
 * and locale were persisted independently with partial bodies, saving one
 * would reset the other to its default.  So both live here and every persist
 * sends the full ``{ theme, locale }``.  Loading is likewise a single GET that
 * populates both (no duplicate request).
 *
 * ``useTheme`` and ``useLocale`` are thin wrappers over this state: the former
 * adds Naive UI theme resolution, the latter adds vue-i18n / ``<html lang>``
 * syncing.  ``localStorage`` is a fast cache; the server is the source of
 * truth for authenticated users.
