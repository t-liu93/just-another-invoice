# Yet Another Ledger · v1 Master Roadmap

> 🌐 **English** · [中文](roadmap_zh.md)

> **What this is**: A **buildable overview** of the agreed v1 scope (P0–P7) — sliced into **M0–M12** following the principles of atomicity, frontend/backend parallelism, and deployable verification at the end of every milestone.
>
> **What this is not**: A line-by-line construction guide. This document stays at the level of "milestones + methodology + constraints"; the **atomic step list** for each milestone is written out JIT in `docs/plan/milestones/M<x>.md` (template: `milestones/_TEMPLATE.md`).
>
> **Authoritative sources**: Direction, scope, domain model, and decision records are governed by **this roadmap + each `milestones/M<x>.md` (frozen per-milestone decisions)**; Dutch VAT/BTW filing conventions are governed by `docs/insight/btw-aangifte-2026-guide.md` (structured guide to the official Tax Authority filing instructions). (Early upstream "analysis documents" were removed from the repository on 2026-06-15 — their content has been absorbed into the above documents; any remaining "analysis doc §x" references in older milestone files are historical artefacts only.)
>
> **Architecture reference**: `~/workspace/trading-journal` (isomorphic, live in production). Skeleton, conventions, Dockerfile, and CI all align with it; the only differences are "swap SQLite for PostgreSQL + invoice domain".

## 0. Agent pre-flight checklist (read these 5 items every time before starting)

1. **Read the constraints first**: [§2 Global Constraints] are the hard guardrails — stop and ask before violating any of them.
2. **Contract first**: Define/update the API contract (Pydantic schema) before writing backend implementation or frontend UI. See [§1.1].
3. **Money calculations only in the backend**: The frontend only collects raw input; all amounts are authoritatively calculated by backend `services/pricing`. See [§2] item 1.
4. **One step = one atomic change + pass DoD**: Atomic, independently deployable, with tests; once CI is green, merge to `main` (solo development — no mandatory PR). Template at [§5].
5. **Regenerate TS types whenever the contract changes**: `npm run codegen`, and ensure the CI drift check passes. See [§1.1] and [§5].

---

## 1. Development Methodology (Four Pillars)

### 1.1 Contract-first → Frontend and backend in parallel

The **first action** for any feature is to lock the API contract: write Pydantic request/response models + route signatures in the backend (stub data is fine initially), and FastAPI produces OpenAPI automatically. Once the contract is locked:

- **Backend track**: Implement `models → schemas → services → api` with real logic + tests.
- **Frontend track**: `npm run codegen` pulls the OpenAPI into `frontend/src/api/schema.d.ts` (**committed to the repo**); the frontend writes stores/views against those types — mock first, then wire up the real API.

Both tracks run in parallel, kept in sync by the single "types + OpenAPI" contract. The CI `codegen-freshness` gate enforces that `schema.d.ts` matches the backend at all times.

### 1.2 Walking Skeleton + vertical thin slices → every milestone is deployable

- **M0 is not "pile up infrastructure"** — it threads the thinnest possible end-to-end path: single container up, FastAPI serving the frontend, health check, one working page, Postgres connected, migrations running, CI green. **Day one you can open a browser and click something.**
- Every subsequent milestone adds **one vertically visible feature** (DB → API → UI end-to-end), not "finish all backend, then all frontend". Each milestone ends with an explicit **deployment smoke test** (see [§4]).

### 1.3 Atomic steps + uniform Definition of Done → maintainable and reviewable

Every atomic step is a small, self-contained change that always follows the reference layering (`models / schemas / services / api`, money logic in `services`) and passes the uniform DoD (see [§5]). **Solo development — no mandatory PR**: self-test + CI green is enough to merge to `main` (branch/PR still available for intentional human review). Benefit: every step is small and isomorphic, easy to read back later.

### 1.4 In-repo Markdown plan documents → vibe-coding friendly

All planning lives as Markdown under `docs/plan/`, version-controlled alongside code and readable by both agents and humans. This document is the overview; milestone details are written JIT into `milestones/M<x>.md`. Structure at [§7].

---

## 2. Global Constraints (Guardrails · Hard Lines)

> Derived from analysis doc §7.3 pitfall list + decision records. **Every agent must read these before starting; stop and ask before violating any.**

1. **Money calculations in the backend**: The frontend only sends `{item_id?, name, description, quantity, unit_price, discount, tax_category_id, ...}` and other raw inputs; backend `services/pricing` is responsible for line subtotals → discounts → tax computation (inclusive/exclusive/compound/fixed) → document totals → base-currency conversion, all produced authoritatively and persisted. All amounts must use **`Decimal`** (DB `NUMERIC`, scale≈3); **rounding rules and positions are fixed** (per-line vs. aggregate rounding mode is fixed).
2. **Multi-tenancy via Postgres RLS, not manual scoping**: Even for v1 single-tenant, converge data access and reserve `company_id` on core tables — no scattered `where company=` clauses. See [§3.3].
3. **No hand-written cascade deletes**: Use DB foreign keys + ORM cascade (`SQLAlchemy relationship(cascade=...)` / `ondelete="CASCADE"`) to eliminate orphaned data.
4. **Concurrency-safe numbering**: No `max+1`; use DB sequences / unique constraints + retry; support **custom starting number and gap skipping** (for migrating from legacy systems).
5. **No stringly-typed settings**: Three-tier settings with typed access (Pydantic/enum) + caching; no `'YES'/'NO'` scattered everywhere.
6. **Normalised tax table structure**: No wide table with a pile of nullable FKs; use normalised polymorphism or separate "document-level tax table / line-level tax table".
7. **Sanitise user input before rendering**: Filter before entering PDF/HTML (XSS/SSRF), following InvoiceShelf's recent sanitiser approach.
8. **Lock exchange rate as a snapshot**: Foreign currency locks the EUR tax base at **invoice date** (VAT compliance); payment date uses a separate cash/FX rate; historical records never drift (analysis doc §7.4.5).
9. **No in-app self-update**: Upgrades go through redeploying the container image; no inbound network entry point that could control the container.
10. **Use `text` for `description`**: Never repeat the 255-character limit mistake.
11. **OpenAPI → TS type generation**: Follow the reference project's approach — consistent frontend/backend types, no contract drift; CI enforces drift detection.
12. **VAT is data-driven, not hardcoded enums**: Tax rates and VAT treatment categories are **user-editable records** (NL defaults 21/9/0 are seeds only); the "category → filing box" mapping is country-specific and decoupled from the rate table (analysis doc §7.4.2).

## 3. Tech Stack and Skeleton (aligned with the reference project)

### 3.1 Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Backend | **FastAPI** + **SQLAlchemy 2.0 (async)** + **Alembic** + **fastapi-users** + **pydantic-settings**; package manager **uv**; Python 3.12 |
| Database | **PostgreSQL** (used from day one, no SQLite; asyncpg driver) + **row-level security RLS** |
| Quality gates | **ruff** (line 100; E/F/I/B/UP/ASYNC) + **mypy --strict** + **pytest** (asyncio auto) |
| Frontend | **Vue 3 + TypeScript** + Pinia + Vue Router + Vite + **Naive UI** + **ECharts**; **openapi-typescript** generates `schema.d.ts` |
| Deployment | **Single container**: three-stage Dockerfile (frontend `vite build` → backend `uv` install deps → runtime serves `static/` + uvicorn); entrypoint runs `alembic upgrade head` |
| CI | GitHub Actions: backend-quality / codegen-freshness / frontend-build / docker-build; tag triggers multi-arch image publish |

> **The only material difference from the reference project**: The reference uses `sqlite+aiosqlite`; this project uses `postgresql+asyncpg` from M0 (laying the groundwork for RLS). Everything else — skeleton, Dockerfile layers, CI four-gate, codegen flow — is **copied directly**.

### 3.2 Directory skeleton (Python package = `jai`)

```
backend/src/jai/
  main.py            # FastAPI app assembly, route mounting, static serving + SPA fallback
  config.py          # pydantic-settings: DATABASE_URL / SMTP / STATIC_DIR / ...
  db.py              # async engine / session / Base; RLS session context (later)
  auth/              # fastapi-users: users / backend / deps
  models/            # SQLAlchemy ORM (incl. _enums.py, Money/Decimal conventions)
  schemas/           # Pydantic request/response (separate from models; no money logic)
  services/          # Business logic: pricing / numbering / fx / reports ... (money logic here)
  api/               # Routes (/api/v1/*): thin controllers, call services
backend/alembic/     # migrations
frontend/src/        # api(schema.d.ts) / stores / views / components / router / ...
Dockerfile           # three-stage single container
.github/workflows/   # ci.yml / release.yml
docs/                # insight (analysis) + plan (this roadmap + milestones)
```

### 3.3 "Multi-tenant-friendly schema + single-tenant simple logic" baseline

- v1 implements **single company, single user**, but the schema is not hardcoded as a singleton: "company/business entity" is built as a proper table (v1 has one row), with core business tables carrying an ownership reference.
- Whether `company_id` is added now or via a later Alembic migration is **deferred to each milestone's table design** (default preference: core business tables carry `company_id` from M2 onward, reserving a slot for RLS).
- RLS / multi-user RBAC / multi-company switching UI and similar **application-layer complexity are explicitly out of scope for v1** — only schema hooks are reserved.

## 4. Milestone Map M0–M12 (including inserted M2.5 · Settings UX refactor / M6.5 · Cost accounting / M11 · Mileage expenses / M11.5 · Quote deposits)

> Dependencies: **M0 → M1 → M2 → (M2.5) → {M3, M4}**, then two parallelisable tracks:
> ① **Document track**: M5 → M6 → **M6.5** → M7; ② **Expense track**: M8 (depends only on M2 base currency + M4 dictionaries, optionally M3 customers, **independent of invoices/quotes/payments**). The two tracks converge at M9 → M10, then continue through **M11 (private-transport business mileage) → M11.5 (quote deposits and final-invoice settlement) → M12 (wrap-up)**.
> Parallelisable: M3‖M4; document track‖expense track (M8 can run alongside M5/M6/M7). **M2.5 is a pure frontend UX fix, non-blocking** — it slots after M2 and can run in parallel with M3/M4; it blocks nothing. The "🟢 deployment smoke test" at the end of each entry is that milestone's acceptance signal.

### M0 · Foundation skeleton (walking skeleton) | corresponds to P0
- **Goal**: Thinnest possible end-to-end path running in a single container.
- **Key content**: Build `jai` backend skeleton + Vue frontend skeleton mirroring the reference project; integrate **PostgreSQL + asyncpg**; Alembic baseline migration; three-stage Dockerfile + entrypoint; CI four gates; `/api/health`; **Money/Decimal currency primitive types** (`NUMERIC` convention + rounding utilities); i18n scaffold (EN/ZH skeleton); `openapi-typescript` codegen wired up.
- **Two running modes (both must work in M0; base `docker-compose.yml` contains `app` + `postgres`; DB does not publish to the host; app publishes only to `127.0.0.1:${APP_HOST_PORT:-8000}` for local reverse-proxying, container-internal port fixed at 8000; local development overlays `docker-compose.dev.yml` which binds Postgres only to `127.0.0.1`, port adjustable via dev-only `POSTGRES_DEV_PORT`)**:
  - **Development mode**: Frontend `npm run dev` (Vite) | Backend `uv run uvicorn jai.main:app --reload` | Database **`docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d postgres` (only the Postgres service)**.
  - **Deployment mode**: `docker compose up -d` (starts **single-container app = built frontend + backend**, plus **Postgres**; production pulls from GHCR, local integration uses dev override `up --build`); migration service automatically runs `alembic upgrade head`.
- **Tables/placeholders**: Alembic starting point; stub RLS session hook location.
- **🟢 Deployment smoke test**: Local integration `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build` starts app + Postgres; production `docker compose up -d` pulls from GHCR; browser opens `http://localhost:${APP_HOST_PORT:-8000}` and sees a (blank) placeholder page + `/api/health` returns ok; CI all green.

### M1 · Authentication + email foundation | corresponds to P1
- **Goal**: A private application where users can register/log in, and emails can be sent.
- **Key content**: fastapi-users username+password (**Argon2**); **MFA (TOTP) — essential for accounting software**; login/logout UI; protected routes + empty shell dashboard.
- **Email foundation (done in this milestone, reused directly by M9)**: SMTP sending via a Python package; **password-reset email**; **settings table basics** (single table + `level` for the three-tier settings, initially used for SMTP config) + **SMTP settings page** (frontend form to fill and save).
- **Tables/placeholders**: `user` table with `company_id` + `role` fields from the start (RBAC added later; v1 owner has full access); **settings table (key-value + level) lands here**; M2 extends it with company/user tiers.
- **🟢 Deployment smoke test**: Register → login → bind TOTP → reach the empty dashboard; fill in SMTP on the settings page → trigger password reset → receive the email; after logging out, protected pages redirect to login.

### M2 · Company profile + three-tier settings (complete) | corresponds to P1
- **Goal**: Ability to configure "your business entity".
- **Key content**: Singleton **business profile** (name/logo/VAT number/address/base currency/numbering rules); on top of **the settings table landed in M1**, complete **three-tier semantics** (global/company/user, scope id, typed access + caching, fallback order user→company→global) + company/user-level settings UI pages.
- **Tables/placeholders**: `company` table lands (v1: one row); settings table `level`/scope designed to be multi-company-friendly.
- **🟢 Deployment smoke test**: Edit company letterhead/logo/base currency and persist; change a user-level preference and verify fallback takes effect.

### M2.5 · Unified settings entry + settings UX refactor (Affine-style expandable panel) | new in this roadmap (UX fix, no new backend features)
- **Goal**: Consolidate the currently scattered, semantically confusing settings entry points into "a single gear icon in the top-right → a unified expandable settings panel", aligned with the Affine settings UX.
- **Dependencies**: M2 (company profile + three-tier settings already in place). **Pure frontend refactor** — does not touch backend contracts or money logic; **non-blocking**, can run in parallel with M3/M4.
- **Current pain points (why we're doing this)**:
  - The top-right "avatar" icon opens Preference, while a separate "Settings" entry next to it only contains SMTP;
  - After entering Preference, the top-right icon changes to a no-icon Company/other state — **entries scattered everywhere, icon and content semantics inconsistent**.
- **Boundary principle (define and acknowledge before coding)**: The gear panel **contains only "Preference" settings + system configuration** (SMTP, theme…); **business entity identity** (letterhead / logo / VAT number / address / base currency / numbering rules) belongs to Company, placed under the **Company icon's Company settings**, **not in the gear panel**. The two have non-overlapping responsibilities.
- **Key content**:
  - **Single entry point**: Top-right retains only **one gear icon** as the total settings entry; clearly distinguished from the **dedicated Company icon (business identity area)** in the top-right — the Company one does not merge into settings.
  - **Expandable panel (not a plain dropdown)**: Clicking the gear opens an Affine-style **Expandable Menu / settings panel** — categories on the left, details on the right, editable in place.
  - **Settings categories consolidated** (all into this one panel):
    1. **Preference settings**: User/company-level preference toggles and defaults (language, default values…), **excluding business entity identity** (that's Company's domain);
    2. **Email settings**: SMTP etc., fill and save in place (reuses M1/M2 existing endpoints);
    3. **Theme**: Dark mode, default theme, and other scattered items **all consolidated here**;
    4. **Future expansion slot**: Later settings such as AI are entered from this panel (**category slot reserved**, no concrete functionality in this milestone).
- **Out of scope**: No new backend fields/endpoints (contract alignment only if needed, no money logic); custom themes and multi-company switching are not in this milestone.
- **Follow-up (scheduled · account-level language persistence)**: The main M2.5 body makes language session-scoped (retaining the old 🌐 behaviour — resets on refresh); a follow-up adds language persistence **like theme, following the account** — adds a `locale` field to `UserPreferences` at the USER level, reuses `GET/PUT /settings/me`, and the frontend mirrors the `useTheme` pattern of "localStorage cache + server authoritative". This is **the only intentional small extension** to the "zero backend" boundary above (one field, no money logic, requires regenerating `schema.d.ts`); details in `milestones/M2.5.md` step 4.
- **🟢 Deployment smoke test**: Top-right retains only **one gear + one Company icon**; clicking the gear opens the expandable panel; within the panel, complete "company preference / SMTP / theme switch" for all three setting categories and persist; the "avatar turns into Preference, icon disappears" confusion never recurs.

### M3 · Customers | corresponds to P2 (parallelisable with M4)
- **Goal**: Ability to manage customer records.
- **Key content**: Customer CRUD + list; billing/shipping **addresses**; per-customer default currency (locked once a transaction exists); **country + VAT number** (groundwork for M10's ICP / reverse-charge determination); long-tail fields via **JSONB**.
- **Tables/placeholders**: `customer.company_id`; address uses `type` (BILLING/SHIPPING).
- **🟢 Deployment smoke test**: Create/edit/delete customers, fill address and VAT number, search the list.

### M4 · Dictionaries / master data | corresponds to P2 (parallelisable with M3)
- **Goal**: Dictionaries needed by documents are ready.
- **Key content**: **Tax types/VAT treatment categories** (data-driven; NL 21/9/0/exempt/reverse/EU-B2B/export as seeds, see analysis doc §7.4.2); payment methods; expense categories (aligned with NL/EU conventions); currencies + exchange rate basics (manual entry, provider interface stubbed out); **product/materials catalogue (data foundation for M6.5 cost accounting)** — entries carry "purchase cost (excl. VAT) + category + unit + category-default Margin Rate", manual CRUD + supplier Excel paste/import; margins and categories are always **data-driven and editable** (guardrail 12), not hardcoded enums.
- **Tables/placeholders**: Tax category table **decoupled** from "filing box mapping"; abstract exchange-rate provider interface; cost field in the product catalogue is the "current price" — historical snapshots are locked by each estimate that uses it (see M6.5).
- **🟢 Deployment smoke test**: Maintain tax rates/payment methods/expense categories, seed data visible and editable; create a few products/materials with default margins, import a batch of supplier prices via Excel.

### M5 · Pricing engine + invoice core | corresponds to P3 (the "heart" of v1)
- **Goal**: Ability to issue an invoice with amounts authoritatively calculated by the backend.
- **Key content**: **`services/pricing` authoritative calculation** (line subtotals → line/document discounts → per-document/per-line tax → inclusive/exclusive → totals → base-currency conversion, rounding fixed); `POST /invoices/calculate` preview endpoint; invoice CRUD + list; **numbering** (templated + custom starting number + gap skipping + concurrency-safe); **dual status** (lifecycle status + payment status); line items (free-form `description` as `text`, quantity required, unit optional, optional catalogue reference).
- **Tables/placeholders**: Normalised tax tables (document-level/line-level separate tables or proper polymorphism); `unique_hash` field reserved (public link not enabled in v1).
- **🟢 Deployment smoke test**: Create an invoice, add multiple lines, toggle per-document/per-line tax, observe backend-calculated subtotals/tax/totals; change the starting number and verify it takes effect.

### M6 · Quotes + conversion + content templates | corresponds to P3
- **Goal**: Complete quote workflow + document content reuse.
- **Key content**: Quote CRUD (isomorphic with invoices); **simplified status** draft/sent/accepted/rejected/expired (removed: viewed); **auto-expire on due date** (backend timer, APScheduler); **Convert quote → invoice**; **document content templates** (one-click fill for common trade quotes/invoices); **standard content blocks** (warranty/T&C/bank info/payment terms, company-level defaults overridable per document); document **Notes** (free-form notes + reusable templates).
- **🟢 Deployment smoke test**: Create a quote, apply a content template, mark accepted, one-click convert to invoice; expired quotes automatically set to expired by the timer.

### M6.5 · Cost accounting / quote assistance (internal estimation → quote) | new in this roadmap (core author workflow, replacing the existing Excel)
- **Goal**: Use an **internal** "cost → selling price" worksheet to assist quote pricing (blue-collar / renewable energy installation context).
- **Dependencies**: M4 **product/materials catalogue** + M5 **pricing engine** (reuse its VAT/total layer, **no re-computation of tax**) + M6 **quote entity**. Slots after M6 on the document track, before M7.
- **Key content**:
  - **Estimate entity + unified line model**: Each line `Total = Price × Amount`, `Margin Amount = Total × Margin Rate`, `line selling price (excl. VAT) = Total + Margin Amount`; **labor / shipping / travel / overhead are all ordinary lines with Margin Rate = 0** (no separate line types); travel and overhead typically appear as **one document-level line each**.
  - **Three rolling summaries**: Total Margin (equipment profit only) / **Total Excl. VAT** (Σ line selling prices) / Total Incl. VAT (**passed to M5 engine to add 21% VAT**; costing does not compute tax itself).
  - **`services/costing` authoritative calculation**: `Decimal` + fixed rounding (per-line vs. aggregate mode nailed down when this milestone is detailed); **money logic must have unit tests** (guardrail 1).
  - **Estimation → quote linkage (non-one-to-one)**: Estimate lines can be **grouped**; each group generates **one quote line** — carrying only the **public description (brand / kWh and other publicly shareable parameters) + excl. VAT price (= that group's Σ line selling prices)**; the quote line then goes through M5 to produce the incl. VAT total.
- **Tables/placeholders**: Estimate lines **snapshot** the cost at the time (decoupled from M4 catalogue — later price changes in the catalogue do not affect historical estimates); estimate and quote use a "group → quote line" weak association, not forced one-to-one.
- **Guardrails specific to this milestone (extensions of guardrails 7/8 — acknowledge before writing code)**:
  1. **Zero customer-facing leakage**: Estimate cost / Margin / hourly-rate fields are **never** serialised into quotes / PDFs / public links (extension of guardrail 7).
  2. **Cost snapshot**: Updating catalogue prices **does not back-fill** historical estimates; history never drifts (same as guardrail 8).
- **🟢 Deployment smoke test**: Create an estimate, add several equipment lines (with margins) + labour/freight lines (margin 0), observe the backend-calculated excl. VAT selling price and Total Margin; select a group to generate one **public quote line** (confirm no cost/margin/hourly rate is visible on the customer side); that quote goes through M5 to produce the 21% incl. VAT total.

### M7 · Payments | corresponds to P4 (parallelisable with M8)
- **Goal**: Invoices can receive payments, and status transitions automatically.
- **Key content**: Payment entity (linked to invoice / standalone); **partial/multiple payments** (deposit/progress/final); payment methods; **exchange rate locked at payment time** (EUR rate on payment date); automatic recalculation of `due_amount` and `paid_status`.
- **🟢 Deployment smoke test**: Apply two separate payments to one invoice and observe UNPAID → PARTIALLY_PAID → PAID automatic transitions.

### M7.5 · Currency rounding correction (round to the minor unit) | new in this roadmap (M5 money rounding fix, spans document track / expense track)
- **Goal**: Make all **customer-facing / reconciliation / filing monetary amounts** consistently land on the currency's minor unit (v1 = EUR = 2 decimal places / cents), so that "frontend display = amount due = backend reconciliation = supplier invoice / bank statement" are all self-consistent; **unit prices and intermediate calculations retain ≥3 decimal places** unchanged.
- **Background**: The M7 payment walkthrough revealed that invoice incl. VAT totals were stored at 3 decimal places (e.g. `F2026-009 = 3865.166`), the UI displayed `3865.17`, and payments rounded to cents could never balance. Root cause: M5 only quantised the **amount due** to 3 places and never rounded to cents (guardrail 1's "rounding position is fixed" is exactly this).
- **Dependencies / position**: Modifies **M5 `services/pricing`** (+ M6.5 customer-facing costing and M8 expense when they land); positioned **after M7, before M8** (M8 expenses follow the same convention — supplier invoices and bank statements are already at cent precision).
- **Key decisions (frozen · see `milestones/M7.5.md`)**: **Round at line level** (sub-variant of Method B — `quantity × unit_price` result rounded to cents immediately; each line's net/VAT/total rounded to cents; document total = sum of lines; multi-line same-rate: no group-level allocation; `F2026-009` → `3865.16`); only `unit_price` retains ≥3 places; rounding direction follows `amounts_include_vat`; applies to all document-level output amounts (invoice/quote/customer-facing estimate/expense); **no column type change / no contract change / no migration** (`NUMERIC(18,3)` can hold 2 decimal places); **no rounding to whole euros** (VAT must be filed at cent precision); introduces `currency_minor_unit` (EUR=2 hardcoded + extension point); **no historical recomputation** (project not yet live, all test data — recreate old documents as needed); `services/costing` and `services/payment` zero changes.
- **🟢 Deployment smoke test**: After recomputation, an `F2026-009`-style invoice total lands at cents and can be fully paid (reaching `COMPLETED`) using the displayed amount; a multi-line multi-rate invoice has each VAT group rounded to cents with excl+vat=total self-consistent, matching supplier invoices/bank statements.

### M8 · Expenses | corresponds to P4 (independent track: depends only on M2+M4, parallelisable with the entire document track M5/M6/M7)
- **Goal**: Ability to record expenses and auto-fill receipts intelligently.
- **Dependencies**: M2 (base currency) + M4 (expense categories/payment methods/currencies); optionally M3 customers. **Independent of invoices/quotes/payments** — available to start in parallel with the document track as soon as M4 is done.
- **Key content**: Expense CRUD + categories; **receipt upload** (image/PDF, local storage + storage abstraction); **recurring expenses** (fixed costs automatically generated on a schedule); **⭐ AI receipt smart fill** (receipt image → vision language model → auto-fill net amount/VAT amount/rate/supplier/date/category; external dependency: Claude or other vision model APIs); per-expense flag for "deductible".
- **(Follow-on) ⭐ AI supplier price list recognition → import to product catalogue**: **Reuses this milestone's vision model pipeline** to take supplier price lists (image / PDF / Excel) → auto-recognise → load into **M4's product/materials catalogue** (feeds M6.5 cost accounting); scheduled after M8 AI infrastructure is in place.
- **🟢 Deployment smoke test**: Upload a receipt photo, AI auto-fills the expense fields, save and categorise; create a recurring expense and observe automatic generation.

### M8.5 · Expense bookkeeping fields (aligned with author's NL bookkeeping Excel) | new in this roadmap (M8 data model completion, no new money logic)
- **Goal**: Add three **record-only** fields to expenses to make the data model reflect the author's Dutch sole-trader bookkeeping Excel — **payment source** (private/business account), **business use percentage**, **depreciation years**.
- **Dependencies / position**: Additive field extension on top of the **M8** expense track; positioned **after M8, before M9**. **No new money logic** — current-year actual expense / deductible VAT by year / quarterly aggregation / BTW boxes and other derived values are all deferred to **M10** (they depend on "which year is being filed", a reporting engine concern).
- **Key content**: Add `paid_by` (PRIVATE/BUSINESS indicator), `business_percentage` (0–100), `depreciation_years` (≥1) columns to `expense` (+ `recurring_expense` parity); editor/list UI + i18n; contract change → `npm run codegen`. `deductible` semantics unchanged (= can VAT be reclaimed); personal-header non-deductible VAT handled at entry time (Net = Gross, VAT = 0), no new modelling. See `milestones/M8.5.md` (D1–D9 frozen).
- **🟢 Deployment smoke test**: New expenses can fill private/business, business%, depreciation years and persist; M8-era old expenses migrated with defaults (Business/100/1); range validation (%∈[0,100], years≥1); three fields visible in list; CI green + `schema.d.ts` no drift.

### M9 · Output: PDF (email foundation already in M1) | corresponds to P5
- **Goal**: Ability to deliver documents to customers.
- **Key content**: **PDF generation** (one template set, Jinja2 + WeasyPrint candidate; user input sanitised) + download (no public link, manual distribution); **reuse M1's SMTP foundation**, add document **email body templates/placeholders** + **Email log** (no read receipts) + send PDF as attachment; payment receipt PDF (low priority).
- **Tables/placeholders**: PDF template reserves a CSS interface (custom templates not done in v1).
- **🟢 Deployment smoke test**: Download an invoice PDF (letterhead/line items/tax/totals correct); use the SMTP configured in M1 to send an invoice email + PDF attachment, and see the log entry in Email log.

### M10 · Reports / dashboard | corresponds to P6
- **Goal**: VAT filing and business performance made visible.
- **Key content**: **P/L** profit and loss; **⭐ VAT filing summary** (quarterly + VAT category aggregation into BTW boxes 1a/1b/1e/2a/3a/3b/4a/4b/5a/5b/5c + generate **ICP list**; conventions from analysis doc §7.4, exact numeric conventions finalised at implementation time); expense report; **Dashboard** (ECharts charts).
- **⚠️ Outstanding item from M4 (mandatory)**: M4 created the `vat_treatment.report_box` column but **left it empty**. This milestone must **jointly confirm with the author** the `(treatment × rate) → BTW box` mapping against the official Belastingdienst website before populating it — **agents must not act unilaterally**. See `milestones/M4.md` "JIT review confirmed" and memory `vat-model-two-axis`.
- **🟢 Deployment smoke test**: Select a quarter, export VAT summary and ICP; Dashboard displays revenue/expense/profit charts.

### M11 · Mileage expenses (private transport used for business) | expense-track extension
- **Goal**: Record privately owned or privately rented transport used for business by entering the trip date and one-way kilometres (optionally return), with the backend creating the correct Expense from an effective-dated rate.
- **Key content**: Expense page gains Purchase/Mileage tabs; company-editable transport-type dictionary; general effective-dated mileage rates with optional per-type overrides; 2024/2025 €0.23 and 2026 €0.25 editable seeds; optional origin/destination/purpose/note; backend-only Decimal distance×rate calculation; Mileage category + Expense projection into existing P/L/Dashboard/Expense Report with €0 VAT; explicit preview/confirm/audit for retrospective rate corrections. Existing expenses and Travel category remain untouched. See `milestones/M11.md` (D1–D18 frozen 2026-08-19).
- **Boundary / follow-on**: M11 only creates claims for private transport. Company vehicles use actual-cost accounting and are deferred; the trip model leaves an additive extension point. Google Places/Routes address autocomplete and route distance are a later optional follow-on—M11 performs no external map calls and manual kilometres remain authoritative.
- **🟢 Deployment smoke test**: Configure general/type-specific rates; create a 12.5 km one-way return Car trip dated in 2026 and see 25 km → €6.25; verify Purchase/Mileage tabs and existing reports; preview then confirm one retrospective rate correction and inspect its audit record; BTW totals remain unchanged.

### M11.5 · Quote deposits and final-invoice settlement | document-track extension
- **Goal**: Record one or more deposits on an accepted quote before its final invoice exists, atomically carry them to the converted invoice, and recognise VAT at the payment date without double-filing it when the final invoice is issued.
- **Key content**: Quote-origin payments with immutable quote provenance; deterministic mixed-rate VAT snapshots; quote→DRAFT-invoice transfer and payment-state recomputation; guarded final-invoice edits and lifecycle transitions; quote-stage non-VAT payment receipts; final invoice PDF payment breakdown; BTW advance recognition and final-invoice offsets; full quote/invoice/global-payments frontend workflow. The 2026-08-28 walkthrough refinement adds locale-single-language receipt warnings and source-audited receipt email. Only `NL_DOMESTIC` advances are supported. See `milestones/M11.5.md` (D1–D15 frozen 2026-08-27).
- **Boundary / follow-on**: No formal advance invoice, standalone customer credit, refund/negative/overpayment, unrelated-invoice reassignment, percentage deposit calculator, cross-border/reverse-charge/export advance handling, historical tax-snapshot backfill, or filed-period correction workflow.
- **🟢 Deployment smoke test**: Accept an €8,000 domestic quote; record €1,600 and €4,000 deposits; download EN/ZH quote receipts with the matching single-language non-VAT warning; send a localized receipt and inspect its source-document audit log; convert once to a DRAFT invoice showing €5,600 paid and €2,400 due; verify edit/delete/reconvert/issue guards; issue the complete invoice and pay the €2,400 balance; confirm cross-quarter BTW totals recognise the deposits early and the project exactly once overall.

### M12 · Wrap-up / pre-GA health check | corresponds to P7
- **Goal**: Ready for long-term self-hosting.
- **Key content**: **Backup scripts** (pg_dump + volume snapshot); i18n **EN/ZH completion**; security/performance polish; documentation (deployment README).
- **Migration baselining — DROPPED (decided 2026-06-19)**: The original plan was to collapse the accumulated Alembic migrations into a single baseline *before* the 1.0 launch, whose sole precondition was "no production data yet (dev DB can be freely rebuilt)". Since **`v0.1.0` already went live for self-use (2026-06-17)**, that window is closed — the production DB carries real data and its `alembic_version` sits at the current head, so collapsing would only risk a mismatch for no gain. We therefore **keep the accumulated linear migration chain as-is**; a fresh DB simply replays it on first boot (functionally identical, negligible startup cost). From here on, **additive migrations only**, exactly as the original "never collapse after launch" rule already intended.
- **Release tagging — `latest` handling (done 2026-06-17, with `v0.1.0`)**: `release.yml` now uses `flavor: latest=auto`, so only non-prerelease semver tags (e.g. `v0.1.0`) move `:latest`; prereleases (`v0.1.0-betaN`) never touch it. (Before the stable `0.1.0`, betas intentionally moved `:latest` so production running the `:latest` image could pick them up; that exception ended the moment `0.1.0` shipped.)
- **🟢 Deployment smoke test**: Run a full backup/restore drill; switch between EN/ZH UI completely.

## 4.x Beyond the roadmap (vNext) · External bank feed integration (memo only, not in M0–M12)

> **Status**: Explicitly **not doing** in the current roadmap through M12; this note is kept here so it's easy to pick up later. **No DB schema is reserved now** — any future columns/tables are additive migrations, existing data is unaffected, cost is acceptable, no need to pre-allocate.

- **What it is**: Connect an **external transaction provider** and automatically pull transaction feeds from partner banks via API, eliminating manual entry. **Provider-agnostic**: Plaid (used behind YNAB), GoCardless Bank Account Data (formerly Nordigen, EU open banking, AIS free tier), Tink / TrueLayer, etc. — selection deferred.
- **Two use cases**:
  - **Payment reconciliation**: Read feed Descriptions (use an LLM to recognise Invoice Numbers etc.) → attempt to match existing invoices → link / suggest a Payment (connects to M7).
  - **Expense import**: Turn feed entries directly into expenses, pre-filling known fields (amount / date / counterparty); at bookkeeping time, use **M8's AI receipt fill** to complete net amount / VAT rate / category (connects to M8).
- **Sync semantics (key product direction, YNAB-style)**:
  - **Sync only from first connection onwards**; it is fine if **historical data is not back-filled** — consolidate the current state at connection time.
  - **Matching is not required**: Reconciliation is a best-effort convenience feature, not a prerequisite for accounting correctness.
  - **Bank feed is not the single source of truth**: Small businesses have **cash income/expenses that don't go through bank accounts**, so **full real-time sync is not required** on either side; the feed is just one convenient input source. Specific reconciliation / deduplication logic deferred.
- **Implementation principles (when actually built)**: **Polling not webhooks** (self-hosted, no inbound entry points, guardrail 9); provider behind an **abstract interface** (same as M4's exchange-rate provider); credentials use M2 typed settings + at-rest encryption. Low sync frequency (once or twice a day is sufficient), pay-as-you-go cost-friendly.

## 4.y Beyond the roadmap (vNext) · PDF document/letterhead template customisation (memo only, not in M0–M12)

> **Status**: Raised by the author in the 2026-06-14 M9 walkthrough, explicitly **deferred**. Elaborates on M9's OUT item "custom / multiple PDF template sets → deferred (one template family + CSS interface)". **No schema reserved now** — everything will be additive.
>
> **Partially shipped ahead (2026-06-29)**: the minimal subset — a company `legal_name` field + an auto-rendered "trade name of" disclosure sentence in the per-page footer of every invoice/quote/receipt PDF — the footer leads with `{trade} is a trade name of {legal}` instead of the bare trade name (locale-aware EN/ZH, rendered only when `legal_name` is set; empty/whitespace treated as unset) — was pulled forward and implemented (migration 0025, label `trade_name_disclosure`; orchestrator single-step, blind-reviewed with zero findings). The **full template editor** (freely repositionable `{{ }}` placeholder blocks) remains vNext as described below.

- **What it is**: Make invoice/quote PDF templates **editable in Settings**, **modelled on M9's email templates** — plain text + `{{ }}` placeholders (e.g. `{{COMPANY_NAME}}` / `{{EMAIL}}` / `{{ADDRESS}}` / `{{LEGAL_NAME}}` …), with these blocks **freely repositionable**. **Primarily targets the letterhead** (company identity block), e.g. optionally adding "Trade name of <legal name>", sometimes included, sometimes not.
- **Reusable foundation already available**: Typed settings + three-tier locale resolution chain + settings panel (gear expandable panel) + placeholder engine — all of it is the M9 email template infrastructure (`doc_type × locale`).
- **The big concern is security (guardrail 7)**: User input entering PDF = XSS/SSRF surface; reuse / strengthen sanitisation — reference the two bugs fixed 2026-06-14: `{{ css | safe }}` font escaping and SVG `<style>` inline class sanitisation; body uses "plain text + explicit placeholders + escaping" rather than arbitrary HTML/CSS. Plus template editor UI + preview + built-in defaults when values are absent.
- **Granularity**: Configured per document type (invoice / quote) × language (EN / ZH), following the email template structure.

## 4.z Beyond the roadmap (vNext) · Customer address free-text block (memo only, not in M0–M12)

> **Status**: Raised by the author in the 2026-06-14 M9 walkthrough, explicitly **deferred**.

- **What it is**: Below the customer's **structured address** (street / house number / postcode / province / city / country), add a **free-form text area**.
- **Use case**: **Bilingual customers** — structured fields are filled with Latin/English address; the free-text area holds the **same address repeated in another script** (e.g. Chinese).
- **Implementation sketch (when built)**: Add one additive text column to the `address` (or customer) model (guardrail 10: `text`) + schema + customer editor UI + invoice/quote PDF renders the free-text below the structured address block (preserve line breaks, autoescape). Bounded scope, but spans model + UI + PDF.

## 5. Atomic step template + Definition of Done

> When detailing a milestone, every atomic step is broken down using this template (see `milestones/_TEMPLATE.md`). **Solo development — no mandatory PR**: self-test + CI green is enough to merge to `main`; open a branch/PR when intentional human review is wanted.

**An atomic step contains:**
- **Goal**: One sentence.
- **Contract**: API schema additions/changes for this step (OpenAPI fragment) — **defined first**.
- **Backend tasks** / **Frontend tasks**: Two columns, parallelisable (both against the contract above).
- **Migration**: Alembic (if tables are created or columns changed).
- **Tests**: Backend pytest (services calculation logic must be tested); frontend basic validation where necessary.

**Definition of Done (every step must pass all of these):**
- [ ] `ruff check` + `mypy --strict` pass
- [ ] `pytest` passes (pricing/numbering/fx/reports and other **money logic must have unit tests**)
- [ ] If the contract changed: `npm run codegen` regenerates `schema.d.ts`, CI drift check passes
- [ ] `frontend` build passes (`vue-tsc + vite build`)
- [ ] **Deployment smoke**: `docker build` passes; the milestone's "🟢 deployment smoke test" can be manually exercised
- [ ] **CI four gates green** (green = merge to `main`; solo development, no mandatory PR)
- [ ] Complies with [§2 Global Constraints], no violations
- [ ] Self-check: naming/layering consistent with the reference project, `description` uses `text`, money logic in `services`

## 6. Deployment and smoke-test loop

- **Development mode**: Frontend/backend separated — frontend `npm run dev` (Vite, proxy `/api`), backend `uv run uvicorn jai.main:app --reload`, database via `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d postgres` (only the Postgres service; DB port bound to `127.0.0.1` only, host port adjustable via dev-only `POSTGRES_DEV_PORT`).
- **Deployment mode / milestone acceptance**: Production `docker compose up -d` (**single-container app + Postgres**, pulls from GHCR; migration service automatically runs `alembic upgrade head`); local integration uses `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build` → browser follows the milestone's "🟢 deployment smoke test".
- **CI**: Four gates run on every push; `main`/PR additionally runs docker-build; `v*` tags trigger multi-arch image publishing. Green = merge to `main` (solo development, no mandatory PR).
- At the end of each milestone, record one line of acceptance conclusion + known remainders in `docs/plan/milestones/M<x>.md`.

## 7. Plan document structure & JIT refinement flow

```
docs/
  insight/btw-aangifte-2026-guide.md # Dutch VAT/BTW filing conventions (authoritative, structured guide to official Tax Authority instructions)
  plan/
    roadmap.md                       # This document: overview + methodology + constraints + M0–M12
    milestones/
      _TEMPLATE.md                   # Milestone refinement template
      M0.md, M1.md, ...              # Produced JIT before starting work (atomic step lists)
```

**JIT refinement flow (when entering each milestone)**:
1. Tell the agent: "Read `docs/plan/roadmap.md` §2 constraints + the target milestone's entry, then read the corresponding sections of the analysis documents, then use `milestones/_TEMPLATE.md` to break M<x> into atomic steps."
2. Review the atomic step list for that milestone (backfill "to be refined" product decisions from the analysis docs as needed, e.g. whether units are optional, exact VAT numeric conventions, etc.).
3. Implement step by step, each step passing [§5] DoD.
4. Milestone wrap-up: walk through "🟢 deployment smoke test" and record acceptance conclusion.
